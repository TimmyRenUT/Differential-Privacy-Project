# Differential Privacy

Project for Privacy Preserving Analytics where we taught 10-year-olds about the basics of Differential Privacy. I created a game to illustrate the concept, which can be found at: dpiscool.anvil.app

The code/app can be found by cloning the app in the DP_Game_App_Clone folder.
